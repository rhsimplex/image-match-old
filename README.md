# image-match
image-match is a simple package for finding approximate image matches from a
corpus.  It is similar, for instance, to [pHash](http://www.phash.org/), but
includes a database backend that easily scales to billions of images and
supports sustained high rates of image insertion: up to 10,000 images/s on our
cluster!

Based on the paper [_An image signature for any kind of image_, Wong et
al](http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~hcwong/Pdfs/icip02.ps).  There is an existing
[reference implementation](https://www.pureftpd.org/project/libpuzzle) which
may be more suited to your needs.

The folks over at [Pavlov](https://pavlovml.com/) have released an excellent
[containerized version of image-match](https://github.com/pavlovml/match) for
easy scaling and deployment.

## Quick start
